# Bike-Station-Occupancy-Prediction-Using Machine-Learning

Predicting bike station occupancy for the Dublin stations "Mount Street Lower" and "St. Stephen's Green East." Ridge Linear Regression and kNN models, along with a baseline model, are used for prediction and evaluated using r2 score, Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
